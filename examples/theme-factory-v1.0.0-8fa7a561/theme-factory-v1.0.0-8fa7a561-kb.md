2. **Ask for their choice**: Ask which theme to apply to the deck
3. **Wait for selection**: Get explicit confirmation about the chosen theme
4. **Apply the theme**: Once a theme has been chosen, apply the selected theme's colors and fonts to the deck/artifact

The following 10 themes are available, each showcased in `theme-showcase.pdf`:

1. **Ocean Depths** - Professional and calming maritime theme
2. **Sunset Boulevard** - Warm and vibrant sunset colors
3. **Forest Canopy** - Natural and grounded earth tones
4. **Modern Minimalist** - Clean and contemporary grayscale

## Theme Details

Each theme is defined in the `themes/` directory with complete specifications including:
- Cohesive color palette with hex codes
- Complementary font pairings for headers and body text
- Distinct visual identity suitable for different contexts and audiences

## Application Process

After a preferred theme is selected:
1. Read the corresponding theme file from the `themes/` directory
2. Apply the specified colors and fonts consistently throughout the deck
3. Ensure proper contrast and readability
4. Maintain the theme's visual identity across all slides

## Create your Own Theme
To handle cases where none of the existing themes work for an artifact, create a custom theme. Based on provided inputs, generate a new theme similar to the ones above. Give the theme a similar name describing what the font/color combinations represent. Use any basic description provided to choose appropriate colors/fonts. After generating the theme, show it for review and verification. Following that, apply the theme as described above.
